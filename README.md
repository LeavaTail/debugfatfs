## Description

FAT/exFAT has filesystem information in first sector.
(e.g. cluster size, root directory cluster index, ...)  
Some users want to obtain these information to confirm filesystem status.  
In addition, Some developer want to create any FAT/exFAT filesystem image.

debugfatfs can ontain these inforamtion.

- Print Main Boot Sector Field
- Print Cluster/Sector raw data
- Print Directory entry
- Backup/Restore FAT region
- Update FAT entry
- Create/Remove file
- Cluster compaction
- Create Directory entry

:warning: debugfatfs can write filesystem image.
If you don't want, Please add `-r`(read only) option.

## Example

### Normal usage

#### Case 1: Print Main Boot Sector Field

- User can print Main Boot Sector by default. (`-q` option restrict messages)

```sh
$ sudo debugfatfs /dev/sdc1
media-relative sector offset    : 0x00000800 (sector)
Offset of the First FAT         : 0x00000800 (sector)
Length of FAT table             :       1088 (sector)
Offset of the Cluster Heap      : 0x00001000 (sector)
The number of clusters          :      65472 (cluster)
The first cluster of the root   :          4 (cluster)
Size of exFAT volumes           :    8388608 (sector)
Bytes per sector                :        512 (byte)
Bytes per cluster               :      32768 (byte)
The number of FATs              :          1
The percentage of clusters      :          0 (%)
```

#### Case 2: Print Cluster/Sector raw data

- User can print cluster by `-c` option. (print sector by `-s` option)
- User can print cluster by `cluster` command in Interactive Mode.

```sh
$ sudo debugfatfs -q -c 4 /dev/sdc1

#### Case 3: Print Directory entry

- User can print Directory entry by `-e` option.
- User can print Directory entry by `entry` command in Interactive Mode.

```sh
$ sudo debugfatfs -q -e 4 /dev/sdc1
EntryType                       : c0
GeneralSecondaryFlags           : 03
Reserved1                       : 00
NameLength                      : 19
NameHash                        : ffb8
Reserved2                       : 0000
ValidDataLength                 : 0000000000008000
Reserved3                       : 00000000
FirstCluster                    : 00000005
DataLength                      : 0000000000008000
```

### Advanced usage

These usages may corrupt the filesystem images.  
Please be careful while using that!

#### Case 1: Backup/Restore FAT region

- Developer can backup boot and FAT region by `-s` option. (restore by `-l` option)

```sh
$ sudo debugfatfs -q -b 0x100000 /dev/sdc1

- **-a**, **--all** --- Trverse all directories
- **-b**, **--byte**=*offset* --- dump the any byte after dump filesystem information
- **-c**, **--cluster**=*index* --- dump the cluster after dump filesystem information
- **-d**, **--direcotry**=*path* --- read directory entry from path
- **-e**, **--entry=index** --- read raw directory entry in current directory
- **-f**, **--fource** --- write foucibly even if filesystem image has already mounted
- **-i**, **--interactive** --- prompt the user operate filesystem
- **-l**, **--load**=*file* --- Load Main boot region and FAT region from file
- **-o**, **--output**=*file* --- send output to file rather than stdout
- **-q**, **--quiet** --- Suppress message about Main boot Sector
- **-r**, **--ro** --- read only mode
- **-s**, **--save**=*file* --- Save Main boot region and FAT region in file

- **-v**, **--verbose** --- Version mode

And, debugfatfs with interactive mode support these command.

- **ls** --- list current directory contents
- **cd** *path* --- change directory
- **cluster** *cluster* --- print cluster raw-data
- **entry** *index* --- print directory entry
- **alloc** *cluster* --- allocate cluster
- **release** *cluster* --- release cluster
- **fat** *index* *[entry]* --- change File Allocation Table entry
- **create** *file* --- create directory entry
- **remove** *file* --- remove directory entry
- **update** *index* --- update directory entry
- **trim** --- trim deleted dentry
- **help** --- display this help
- **exit** --- exit interactive mode
